            Some boys kiss me, some boys hug me<br/>
            I think they're okay<br/>
            If they don't give me proper credit, I just walk away<br/>
            They can beg and they can plead<br/>
            But they can't see the light, that's right<br/>
            'Cause the boy with the cold hard cash is always Mister Right</p>

        <p>
            'Cause we are living in a material world<br/>
            And I am a material girl<br/>
            You know that we are living in a material world<br/>
            And I am a material girl</p>

        <p>
            Some boys romance, some boys slow dance<br/>
            That's all right with me<br/>
            If they can't raise my interest, then I have to let them be<br/>
            Some boys try, and some boys lie<br/>
            But I don't let them play, no way<br/>
            Only boys that save their pennies make my rainy day</p>

        <p>
            'Cause we are living in a material world<br/>
            And I am a material girl<br/>
            You know that we are living in a material world<br/>
            And I am a material girl<br/>
            Living in a material world<br/>
            And I am a material girl<br/>
            You know that we are living in a material world<br/>
            And I am a material girl</p>

        <p>
            Living in a material world (-terial)<br/>
            Living in a material world<br/>
            Living in a material world (-terial)<br/>
            Living in a material world</p>

        <p>
            Boys may come, and boys may go<br/>
            And that's all right, you see<br/>
            Experience has made me rich, and now they're after me</p>

        <p>
            'Cause everybody's living in a material world<br/>
            And I am a material girl<br/>
            You know that we are living in a material world<br/>
            And I am a material girl<br/>
            Living in a material world<br/>
            And I am a material girl<br/>
            You know that we are living in a material world<br/>
            And I am a material girl</p>
