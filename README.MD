# Material in Action

This repo demonstrates how to implement Material Design in the three most common frameworks in front-end development, as of the time of its creation.

The idea was to show how devs can build simple layouts, conforming to the focused design mentality of Material, with some basic components.  And, as proven in the case of React and Vue, it's so straightforward that even a pure beginner can do it.  See below for a further explanation.

## Libraries Used
- Angular: [https://material.angular.io/](https://material.angular.io/)
- React: [https://material-ui-next.com/](https://material-ui-next.com/)
- Vue: [https://vuematerial.io/](https://vuematerial.io/)

## Running the Projects

Each project was built with the (or in the case of React, one of many) official CLI; so each comes with the default README that said CLI outputs.  You can run each project following the directions listed in said READMEs.

Be sure to install NPM dependencies first!

## A Note on the Code

It's worth pointing out that I'm an Angular guy, so by no means are the React and Vue examples meant to be taken as an example of best practices.  Because for both React and Vue, the folders herein show the first code I've ever written using either.  Really.

So instead, look to them as examples of an implementation of the Material library built for those frameworks.  All of the features attempted in these repos work across the three frameworks (except for form validation in Vue).
